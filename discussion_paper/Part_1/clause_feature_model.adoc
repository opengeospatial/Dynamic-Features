=== A Feature Model for Space Objects

Before we can describe Space Objects, we must first have a conceptual model of the universe. The OGC and ISO TC211 provide that model in ISO 19109. This standard defines the General Feature Model (GFM). The GFM defines the concept of a Feature, its components, and behaviors.

ISO TC211 defines a Feature as an "Abstraction of real world phenomena" (ISO 19101-1:2014)

A Feature, then, is a high level abstraction for anything that does or could exist in the universe. 

The General Feature Model further refines the concept of a Feature. The following principles are most relevant for this discussion:   

. A Feature can be a FeatureType or an Instance of a FeatureType (AnyFeature).
. FeatureTypes can form a taxonomy (inheritance)
. Features possess characteristics (Properties)
. A Property of a Feature can be an Operation, Attribute, or Association.

The resulting model is sufficient to describe a Feature's identity (IdentifiedType), what it is (FeatureType), what it can do (Operations), its observable characterisitics (Attributes), and any associations with other Feature instances.

*Conclusion:* ISO 19109 provides a model for Real World Objects that is suitable for non-terrestrial use.

=== Planetary Reference Systems

NASA, USGA, and the IAU are developing Reference Systems for non-Earth planetary bodies.

ISO 19111 is the international standard for defining Reference Systems

Reference EPSG and NSG registry for examples

Work to do, further refinement of the existing planetary reference systems and develop ISO 19111 compliant descriptions of those reference systems.

Additional work to consider â€“ The Space AOI is likely to require planetary Reference Systems consisting of a point mass with surrounding non-uniform magnetic and gravitational fields. Is this a valid requirement, how do we define such a reference system, and can be extend IAO 19111 to support it.

== Part 2: Reference Systems

=== Planetary Reference Systems

NASA, USGA, and the IAU are developing Reference Systems for non-Earth planetary bodies.

ISO 19111 is the international standard for defining Reference Systems

Reference EPSG and NSG registry for examples

Work to do, further refinement of the existing planetary reference systems and develop ISO 19111 compliant descriptions of those reference systems.

Additional work to consider â€“ The Space AOI is likely to require planetary Reference Systems consisting of a point mass with surrounding non-uniform magnetic and gravitational fields. Is this a valid requirement, how do we define such a reference system, and can be extend IAO 19111 to support it.

=== Local Reference Systems



=== Dynamic Reference Systems



== Part 3: Time

The dominant role of clocks in Space GeoINT - why calendars are not useful.

== Part 4: Systems of Reference Systems

Traditionally we have taken reference systems for granted. Everything was ultimately referenced to the Earth. Not so in Space,

Mickelson Moorely shows us that there is no Universal Reference System. All measurements of location are relative. Object A measures the velocity of Object B relative to itself. This measurement is unique to the A-B relationship. There is no absolute measure of velocity that Object B can report to any obserer. 

Reference System integration - Stages System, GeoPOSE, the need for more complex models

The need for a more robust concept of coordinate system transformation.

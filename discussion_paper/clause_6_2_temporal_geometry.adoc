=== Moving Features

*Topic:* Is the OGC geometry model sufficient to support 3D?

==== Parameter based Properties

ISO 19141 is the standard for Moving Features. It introduces the concept of Feature Properties whose values are a function of an input parameter.

*MF_OneParameterGeometry*

We start our discussion with the class MF_OneParameterGeometry. MF_OneParameterGeometry is a subclass of GM_Object. So moving features have the 3D geometric properties of any other GM_Object. What is different is that this geometry can change as a function of a parameter. 
A one parameter set of geometries is defined as "a function f from an interval t Î [a, b] such that f(t) is a geometry and for each point P Î f(a) there is a one parameter set of points (called the trajectory of P) P(t) : [a, b] ® P(t) such that P(t) Î f(t). A leaf of a one parameter set of geometries is the geometry f(t) at a particular value of the parameter". 

A one parameter geometry instance includes a "leafgeometry()" operation. This operation takes the parameter (t) as input and returns the leaf P(t) for that parameter as a GM_Object.   

*MF_TemporalGeometry*

An MF_TemporalGeometry is a MF_OneParameterGeometry where the parameter is Time expressed as a TM_Coordinate. TM_Coordinate is specified in ISO 19108; it expresses time as a multiple of a single unit of measure such as year, day, or second. The "leafgeometry()" operation of an instance of MF_TemporalGeometry would take a TM_Coordinat in as input and return a GM_Object instance representing the geometry of the Feature at the specified point in time.

*Temporal Properties*

The JSON encoding of the OGC Moving Features standard introduces the concept of temporal properties. 

"A TemporalProperties object is a JSON array of ParametricValues objects that groups a collection of dynamic non-spatial attributes and its parametric values with time."

Logically TemporalProperties should be a subclass of OneParamProperties. Since Geometry is a property, then MF_TemporalGeometry should be a subclass of TemporalProperties. Which gives us the following UML.

Temporal properties are particularly useful for capturing state change. For example, the fuel load of an aircraft will change over time. The leafproperty() operation on a temporal fuel_load object would return the amount of fuel onboard at the specified time.

==== Rigid vs. Plastic

ISO 19141:2008 states that it "defines a method to describe the geometry of a feature that moves as a rigid body."

That may not be a limitation in fact. If our object iS defined by a bounding surface, and that surface is made up of a number of shapes descended from MF_TemporalGeometry, then the surface geometry of our object can change over time. Hence it is not rigid. ISO 19141 can also define deforming (plastic) bodies.

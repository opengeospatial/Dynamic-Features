=== Articulated Geometries

Given a suite of standards which allow you to define time-variant geometric elements, then the next step is to take a collection of those elements and assemble them into a complex object. 

An articulated geometry is such an aggregation where each element has less than 6 degrees of freedom. Each element can move, but its movement is constrained by attachment to one or more additional elements. 

The aggregate as a whole can also move, but that movement becomes more complex. typically we would model movement of the whole as a trajectory of the center of mass. However, the center of mass of an articulating Feature will change as the relative position of the elements change. 



==== GeoPOSE

The Frame Transform is a representation of the transformation taking an Outer Frame coordinate system to an Inner Frame coordinate system. This abstraction is constrained in GeoPose v 1.0 to only allow transformations involving translation and rotation. The intention is to match the usual concept of a pose as a position and orientation. The formalism that expresses a GeoPose Frame Transform is a pair of Reference Frames, Outer and Inner, each defined by a Frame Specification.

A pose has a valid time (GeoPose_instant)

Sequence

The sequence logical model defines a method for packaging of GeoPose data, where multipleGeoPoses in a sequence share the same Outer Frame and there is a time-dependent changing Inner Frame.

==== MISB Staging System

MISB 1906 Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD): Staging System

"The Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD) Model includes locations, orientations, and kinematics (velocity, acceleration, etc.) of platforms, gimbals, sensors, sensor elements, geospatial and other points. The locations and orientations are either absolute references to a well-known frame of reference (e.g., WGS84) or relative references to other locations and orientations. Each location and orientation pairing define a “stage” that has the potential to be the frame of reference for another location and orientation. Linking stages together forms the Staging System. The Staging System then defines an ability to describe, in metadata, the physical make-up and configuration of a system and the time varying physical relationships of the system and its sub-system components."

The MISB Staging System was designed to capture the instateneous configuration of an articulated sensor system.

Stage: a single frame of reference located at a point. It defines the location, orientation, and kinemantics of a coordinate system located at that point. These properties can be defined in terms of absolute values, or as relative values measured from an "parent" reference system.

Constellation: A system of one or more stages where the parent-child relationships between the stages is sufficient to calculate the absolute values for every stage.

Root Stage: This is the starting point for a Constellation. This stage is expressed in absolute values.

The Staging System’s absolute positions use either WGS84 Ellipsoid angular coordinates (i.e., geodetic Latitude, Longitude, Height above Ellipsoid (HAE)), or WGS84 geocentric Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates (i.e., X, Y, Z).

The Staging System’s relative positions use Cartesian coordinates (i.e., x, y, z) measured in meters from the parent stage frame of reference.

The Staging System’s orientations use Euler rotations, measured in radians, around three axes (X, Y, and Z) of a righthanded coordinate system. The Staging System’s absolute orientation has the X, Y, and Z axes aligned with the East, North, and Up (ENU) respectively.

The Staging System standardizes rotations to use a specific order of rotations. The Staging System uses Tait-Bryan angles with a Primary Rotation Order of Z-Y-X (see Appendix C); thereby the first rotation is around the Z-axis, the second rotation is around the new Y-axis (after rotation around the Z-axis), the final rotation is around the new X-axis (after rotation around the Z and then Y axes).

The Staging system does not explicity address temporality. However, this information is passed in the MISB KLV metadata stream. As such, each update is associated with the precision time stamp of that packet.  In addition, an update can be associated with a Timer as described in section ----

Common concepts:

. An "anchor" node which ties the relative coordinates to an absolute CRS
. Local coordinate systems associated with each other through standardized transformations

==== Lorentz Transformation

A transformation between two different coordinate frames that move at a constant velocity and are relative to each other.  

ONly related to changes in inertial reference frames:

* Inertial frames - motion with a constant velocity
* Non-inertial frames - rotational motion with constant angular velocity, acceleration in curved paths.

In the reference frame "F" which is stationary, the coordinate defined are x, y, z, and t.  In another reference frame F' which moves at a velocity v which is relative to F and the observer defines coordinate in the moving reverence frame as x', y', z', t'. In both the reference frames the coordinate axis are parallel and they remain mutually perpedicular.  The relative motion is along the xx' axes. At t = t' = 0, the origins in both reference frames are the same (x,y,z) = (x',y',z') = (0,0,0).

The Lorentz factor g = 1 / (sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2)))

x' = g(x-vt)
t' = g(t-(vx/c^2))
y' = y
z' = z

This is not a complete coordinate transformation since F' has to be rotated and translated so as to be co-linear with F. However, it does add the impact that relative velocity (v) has on the measurements of x and t. In most cases this impact is neglegible (v^2 / c^2 approaches 0).  However, when v is a significant percentage of c it should be applied.

==== Minkowski Space Time

It is basically a combination of 3-dimensional Euclidean Space and time into a 4-dimensional manifold, where the interval of spacetime that exists between any two events is not dependent on the inertial frame of reference. 

Minkowski spacetime is a 4-dimensional coordinate system in which the axes are given by (x, y, z, ct)

Where ct is time (t) times the speed of light (c)

ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2, + dz^2 = the differential arc length in space time where:

. dt = change in time
. dx = change in x direction
. dy = change in y direction
. dz = change in z direction

Key point - while a Lorentz transformation deals with spatial measurements, Minkowski space includes time as part of that space-time.  Thus ds is an arc length through space-time as opposed to a difference in x as in the Lorentz transform.

Question, since c^2dt^2 is a negative term, does that inply that ct is an imaginary number orthagonal to x, y, and z (cti) such that i^2 = -1?

Yes for complex Minkowski space time. Here it is expressed as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2 = const.

Complex Minkowski spacetime was replaced with real Minkowski space time where time is a real coordinate rather than an imaginary one.

Where v is velocity, and x, y, and z are Cartesian coordinates in 3-dimensional space, and c is the constant representing the universal speed limit, and t is time, the four-dimensional vector v = (ct, x, y, z) = (ct, **r**) is classified according to the sign of (c^2 t^2) − r^2. A vector is **timelike** if (c^2 t^2) > r^2, **spacelike** if (c^2 t^2) < r^2, and **null** or **lightlike** if (c^2 t^2) = r^2. This can be expressed in terms of the sign of η(v, v) as well, which depends on the signature. The classification of any vector will be the same in all frames of reference that are related by a Lorentz transformation (but not by a general Poincaré transformation because the origin may then be displaced) because of the invariance of the interval.

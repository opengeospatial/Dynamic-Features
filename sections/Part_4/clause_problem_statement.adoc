=== Reference Systems Problem Statement

Traditionally we have taken reference systems for granted. Everything was ultimately referenced to the Earth. Not so in Space,

Mickelson Moorely shows us that there is no Universal Reference System. All measurements of location are relative. Object A measures the velocity of Object B relative to itself. This measurement is unique to the A-B relationship. There is no absolute measure of velocity that Object B can report to any obserer. 

Reference System integration - Stages System, GeoPOSE, the need for more complex models

The need for a more robust concept of coordinate system transformation.

=== Articulated Geometries

Given a suite of standards which allow you to define time-variant geometric elements, then the next step is to take a collection of those elements and assemble them into a complex object. 

An articulated geometry is such an aggregation where each element has one (1) to six (6) degrees of freedom. Each element can move, but its movement is constrained by attachment to one or more additional elements. 

The aggregate as a whole can also move, but that movement becomes more complex. Typically we would model movement of the whole as a trajectory of the center of mass. However, the center of mass of an articulating Feature may change as the relative position of the elements change. 

Two existing standards address the problem of Articulated Geometries. The MISB Staging System was developed for articulated Motion Imagery capture systems. GeoPOSE also addresses Motion Imagery, but it is more focused on Augmented and Virtual reality. 

It is not likely that either standard provides a complete solution. Their relative merits and deficiencies are discussed in the `Discussion` section as well as proposals for work to be done.

==== MISB Staging System

The Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) develops standards for motion imagery, audio, associated metadata, and their related systems. Exploitation of MISB data requires its precise positioning in space and time. Therefore, a number of MISB standards deal with the derivation of ground coordinates from sensor coordinates.

Motion Imagery systems are typically complex structures consisting of multiple components each capable of independent motion. Measurements of these motions are in a local coordinate reference system. Conversion of a sensor coordinate requires a series of transformations, starting from the detector and working back through the attached components to a core, geolocated component.

Further complicating maters, each component is capable of movement. The transformations are not fixed. They must be calculated from the relative position of each component at the time that the detection was made. This leads to a requirement that for every observation, the relative position and orientation of each component of the collecting system must be captured as well. 

The MISB 1906 Motion Imagery Metadata (MIMD): Staging System standard addresses this requirement. This standard captures the locations, orientations, and kinemantics (velocity, acceleration, etc.) of platforms, gimbals, sensors, sensor elements, geospatial and other points. The locations and orientations are either absolute references to a well-known frame of reference (e.g., WGS84) or relative references to other locations and orientations. Each location and orientation pairing define a “stage” that has the potential to be the frame of reference for another location and orientation. Linking stages together forms the Staging System. The Staging System then defines an ability to describe, in metadata, the physical make-up and configuration of a system and the time varying physical relationships of the system and its sub-system components. 

A UML model for the MISB Staging System is provided in <<figure-staging-system-uml>>.

This model only addresses a single stage. Non-trivial systems will require multiple stages. These stanges are assembled using the `parentStage` association of the `Stage` class. The following three concepts guide the construction of multiple-stage models:

* *Stage:* a single frame of reference located at a point. It defines the location, orientation, and kinemantics of a coordinate system located at that point. These properties can be defined in terms of absolute values, or as relative values measured from an "parent" reference system.

* *Constellation:* A system of one or more stages where the parent-child relationships between the stages is sufficient to calculate the absolute values for every stage.

* *Root Stage:* This is the starting point for a Constellation. This stage is expressed in absolute values (AbsGeocentric or AbsGeodetic).

An example articulated motion imagery system is illustrated in <<figure-staging-system-example>>. The stages which describe this system are described in <<lp-resources-table>>.

The Staging System’s absolute positions use either WGS84 Ellipsoid angular coordinates (i.e., geodetic Latitude, Longitude, Height above Ellipsoid (HAE)), or WGS84 geocentric Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates (i.e., X, Y, Z).

The Staging System’s relative positions use Cartesian coordinates (i.e., x, y, z) measured in meters from the parent stage frame of reference.

The Staging System’s orientations use Euler rotations, measured in radians, around three axes (X, Y, and Z) of a righthanded coordinate system. The Staging System’s absolute orientation has the X, Y, and Z axes aligned with the East, North, and Up (ENU) axis respectively.

The Staging System standardizes rotations to use a specific order of rotations. The Staging System uses Tait-Bryan angles with a Primary Rotation Order of Z-Y-X. The first rotation is around the Z-axis, the second rotation is around the new Y-axis (after rotation around the Z-axis), the final rotation is around the new X-axis (after rotation around the Z and then Y axes).

The Staging system does not explicity address temporality. However, this information is passed in the MISB KLV metadata stream. As such, each update is associated with the precision time stamp of that packet.  In addition, an update can be associated with a Timer as described in section ----

==== GeoPOSE

GeoPOSE is a proposed OGC standard which provides a general purpose alternative to the MISB Staging System. This standard deals with the location and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (Poses) and the aggregation of Poses into more complex structures.

===== Core

A UML model for the core GeoPOSE concepts is provided in <<figure-geopose-core>>

[#figure-geopose-core,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.GeoPOSE Core

The key element in this model is the `FrameTransform` class. This class expresses a transform between a pair of Reference Frames, Outer and Inner, each defined by a Frame Specification.
 
The Frame Transform is a representation of the transformation taking an Outer Frame coordinate system to an Inner Frame coordinate system. GeoPose v 1.0 supports transformations involving translation and rotation. The intention is to match the usual concept of a pose as a position and orientation. 

Outer and Inner Frames are subclasses of the the Frame Class. The Frame class provides a standard means of describing transforms for several common coordinate reference systems. Subclasses of the Frame class also include a model for generic reference frames.  

===== Time

The GeoPOSE time model is rather simple. It does away with calender and restricts time positions to milliseconds of UNIX Time.

.GeoPOSE Time

The most important classes are GeoPose_Instant (a single point in time) and GeoPose_Duration (a period of time).

===== Sequence

The sequence logical model defines methods for packaging GeoPose transformations. It addresses the need to integrate multiple GeoPoses which share the same Outer Frame and posess a time-dependent changing Inner Frame.

The GeoPOSE Standard provides three models for organizing a collection of Inner Frames.

* Stream: the Inner Frame definition (Frame) and an associated time stamp are delivered sequentially.

* Reqular Series: the Inner Frame definitions are delivered as a sequence, separated by a fixed time interval.

* Irregular Series: the Inner Frame definitions and associated time stamps are delivered as a collection. There is no explicit spatial or temporal order to the frames.

==== Discussions

Both models express some common concepts:

. There is an "anchor" node which ties the local coordinates to an absolute (external) CRS.
. Coordinates in one Local coordinate system can be transformed to another through standardized transformations.
. Local coordinate reference systems are not pre-defined. Sufficient information is defined to describe the transformation between any two arbitrary local coordinate systems.
